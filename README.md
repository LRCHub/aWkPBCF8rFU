```
Show you off
Tonight I wanna show you off
What you got
a billion could've never bought
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world we young tonight
I'm coming for ya I'm coming for ya
Cuz all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Body rock
Girl I can feel your body rock
Take a bow
You're on the hottest ticket now
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world we young tonight
I'm coming for ya I'm coming for ya
Cuz all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
(Nicki)
In time, ink lines
Bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine
Ten little letters and a big sign
Justin bieber
You know Im'ma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner
But I gotta keep a eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the Beast
Beauty from the east
Beautiful confessions of a priest
Beast, beauty from the streets
We don't get to cease
Every time beauty on the beats, beats
I wanna feel your body rock
Cuz all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
